# OpeNode.ai
### *Bridging the gap between Physical Infrastructure and Cloud Intelligence.*

##  Mission
OpeNode.ai is a professional ecosystem dedicated to the convergence of **Operational Technology (OT)** and **Information Technology (IT)**. My goal is to shift the educational paradigm toward a practical, business-driven approach by documenting clean, scalable, and replicable engineering processes.

##  Core Identity: The System Builder
As an **IoT Event Orchestrator**, I design end-to-end solutions that connect the silicon (microcontrollers/PLCs) to the cloud (AI/Big Data). 

##  Technical Expertise
- **IoT Event Orchestration:** Managing real-time data streams from the Edge to the Cloud.
- **Industrial Convergence:** Integrating legacy industrial protocols with modern Cloud architectures.
- **Edge AI:** Implementing on-device machine learning for predictive maintenance and industrial monitoring.

##  Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python (AsyncIO, Pydantic, Fast API).
- **Infrastructure:** Google Cloud Platform (Pub/Sub, Cloud Functions, Vertex AI).
- **Protocols:** MQTT, HTTP, WebSockets, Modbus.
- **Hardware:** Open Source Embedded Systems & Industrial Simulation.

##  Project Roadmap
- [ ] **Professional Web Hub:** Deploying the OpeNode.ai platform using Hugo + GitHub Pages.
- [ ] **The Bridge Simulator:** A Python-based industrial data generator for system testing.
- [ ] **Remote Engineering Labs:** Real-time hardware interaction for remote learning and testing.
- [ ] **AI-Driven Analytics:** Integrating anomaly detection models for industrial telemetries.
